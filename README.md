## 🏃‍♀️ Getting started

* Open `SwiftARlps.xcodeproj`.
* Select a development team in the project settings.
* Build and run on your device.

Point your camera at a surface, wait until it detects a surface and then press one of the buttons to place an object.

## Process

* 👩‍👦 Pair up with another attendee.
* 🍴 Fork the repository, and optionally create a branch.
* 💡 Think of a feature to add, you can come up with something yourself or choose from the [issues list](https://github.com/TheSwiftAlps/SwiftARlps/issues).
* 🎯 Commit and push your work, and create a [Pull Request](https://github.com/TheSwiftAlps/SwiftARlps/pulls).

## 🦉 Tips

* Choose a simple feature to add, you can add more complexity later.
* Don't worry about the UI too much, just try make something work.
* There are a bunch of icons to choose from in `Icons.xcassets`.
* If you want to show a message to the user, you can use the `StatusViewController` with a `showMessage(_: String, autoHide: Bool)` method.
